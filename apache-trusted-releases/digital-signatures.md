# Sign Candidate Phase

For certain artifact types in a release the PMC wishes to add Digital Signatures using approved and current services.

Currently ssl.com, but a Google based one may be coming in the summer.

## Policy

- [Signing Releases](https://infra.apache.org/release-signing.html)
- [Code Signing Services](https://infra.apache.org/services.html#code-signing)

> Please validate with Infra that the "Code Signing Service" documents are up to date.

# Tasks

For certain artifact types for certain channels it makes sense to make use of digital signatures other than GPG detached signatures.
