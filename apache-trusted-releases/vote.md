# Vote Phase

The ATR should take over responsibility from the Release Manager for running a Vote where the steps are recorded.

## Policy

- [Release Voting](https://www.apache.org/legal/release-policy.html#release-approval)
- [Voting](https://www.apache.org/foundation/voting.html)
- [Release Votes](https://www.apache.org/foundation/voting.html#ReleaseVotes)
- [Majority Approval](https://www.apache.org/foundation/glossary.html#MajorityApproval)
- [Incubation Releases](https://incubator.apache.org/policy/incubation.html#releases)

## Vote Policy

There are reasonable adjustments that a PMC can apply to a release vote.

1. Normally a vote goes for a minimum of 72 hours. A PMC may choose a longer time period.
   In case of a security emergency a PMC may shorten the time to as soon as there are 3 +1 votes.
2. An RM may wish to check any -1 vote to see if it means the vote should be ended.

## Vote Options

1. Watch for replies to the VOTE thread and try to confirm who the PMC Binding Votes are.
2. Provide a Vote button on a Release Candidate page.

## Tasks

1. Announce the start of the vote with an email that tells people all about the release packages, how to test, and how to vote.
2. Collect votes. If using a vote button then email each vote to the vote thread.
3. When time expires and the vote passes then send the results. If pausing for the RM include that in the results email.
4. If automatically proceeding to make the release then move to either the _passes_ phase or the _failed_ phase.
5. If this is a release for an Incubator podling (PPMC) then the vote pass a second vote phase on general@incubator.apache.org.
